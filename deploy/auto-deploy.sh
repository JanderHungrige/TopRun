# Poll GHCR and roll out the newest image for one environment. Run from cron through
# deploy/roll-all.sh:
#   deploy/auto-deploy.sh deploy/.env.prod   # prod (172.17.0.1:8081)
#
# Same mechanism as the other projects on this host (adapted from NinaNatur's):
#   - the image the stack runs is kept as :<tag>-previous before a new one starts;
#   - a new image has HEALTH_WAIT_TRIES x HEALTH_WAIT_SLEEP seconds to report healthy;
#   - one that does not is rolled back and remembered in deploy/.state/<env>.bad, so the
#     next tick does not roll it forward again (prod would otherwise flap once a minute);
#   - every roll is written, with its digest, to deploy/.state/deploy.log.
# Uses the HOST docker (no Watchtower) so there is never a client-version mismatch.
